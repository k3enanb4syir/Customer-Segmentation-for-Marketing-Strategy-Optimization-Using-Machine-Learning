However, the current marketing strategy relies on guesswork rather than data-driven insights. Manual analysis is inefficient, leading to missed opportunities for targeted engagement.\n\n**The Objective:**\n\n**Supervised Learning:** To propose a model that can classify future customers into these segments instantly. \n\n**Unsupervised Learning:** Automatically group customers into **distinct** segments based on their *Annual Income* and *Spending Score* to identify high-value targets.\n\n**Business Value:** Provide actionable recommendations for each segment to maximize revenue and customer retention.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **🚦 Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport os\n\n# PART 1: LOAD DATA\n# Smart file finder\nfilename = 'Mall_Customers.csv'\nfile_path = None\nsearch_paths = [\n    '/kaggle/input/mall-customers/Mall_Customers.csv',\n    '/kaggle/input/mall-customer-segmentation-data/Mall_Customers.csv',\n    'Mall_Customers.csv'\n]\n\nfor path in search_paths:\n    if os.path.exists(path):\n        file_path = path\n        break\n\nif not file_path and os.path.exists('/kaggle/input'):\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n        if filename in files:\n            file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)\n            break\n\nif file_path:\n    dataset = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n    print(f\"✅ Data loaded from: {file_path}\")\nelse:\n    raise FileNotFoundError(\"CSV not found\")\n\n# Select Annual Income (Column 3) and Spending Score (Column 4)\nX = dataset.iloc[:, [3, 4]].values\n\n# PART 2: THE ELBOW METHOD\n\nprint(\"Elbow Method\")\nwcss = []\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    # ADDED 'n_init=10' HERE TO FIX THE WARNING\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', n_init=10, random_state = 42)\n    kmeans.fit(X)\n    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)\n\n# Plot the Elbow Graph\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker='o', color='blue')\nplt.title('The Elbow Method')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')\nplt.ylabel('WCSS')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n# PART 3: K-MEANS CLUSTERING\n\nprint(\"Training K-Means with 5 Clusters\")\n# ADDED 'n_init=10' HERE TO FIX THE WARNING\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 5, init = 'k-means++', n_init=10, random_state = 42)\ny_kmeans = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\n\n# PART 4: VISUALIZE CLUSTERS\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n\n# Plot each cluster\nplt.scatter(X[y_kmeans == 0, 0], X[y_kmeans == 0, 1], s = 100, c = 'red', label = 'Cluster 1 (Standard)')\nplt.scatter(X[y_kmeans == 1, 0], X[y_kmeans == 1, 1], s = 100, c = 'blue', label = 'Cluster 2 (Careless)')\nplt.scatter(X[y_kmeans == 2, 0], X[y_kmeans == 2, 1], s = 100, c = 'magenta', label = 'Cluster 5 (Budget)')\nplt.scatter(X[y_kmeans == 3, 0], X[y_kmeans == 3, 1], s = 100, c = 'cyan', label = 'Cluster 4 (Sensible)')\nplt.scatter(X[y_kmeans == 4, 0], X[y_kmeans == 4, 1], s = 100, c = 'green', label = 'Cluster 3 (Target/VIP)')\n\n# Plot Centroids\nplt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], \n            s = 300, c = 'yellow', label = 'Centroids', edgecolors='black')\n\nplt.title('Customer Segments')\nplt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')\nplt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-02T07:19:28.019819Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-02T07:19:28.020114Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-02T07:19:34.273155Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-02T07:19:28.020086Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-02T07:19:34.272231Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Explanation:**\n\nIn the first graph, the 'Elbow Method,' we looked for the point where the error rate flattens out.

If No, go Right.\n\n**The Result:** We can now type in a new customer's details (like Age 25, Income $80k), and the model instantly tells us they are likely a VIP (Cluster 3).\n\nTo classify new customers without re-doing the entire analysis every time, we use a supervised learning method called a Decision Tree. Think of this like teaching the computer to play a game of \"20 Questions.\" We show the computer our existing customers, their age, income, gender, and which group they belong to and it automatically learns the rules that define each group. For example, it might figure out that \"anyone under 30 with a high income is usually in the VIP group.\" The result is a simple flowchart where we can drop in a new customer's details, follow the Yes/No paths based on their profile, and instantly predict exactly which customer segment they belong to.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Business Recommendations & Strategy**\n\nBased on the clustering analysis, we have identified 5 distinct customer personas:\n\n1.  **The Savers (Low Spend, High Income):**\n    * *Observation:* These customers earn well but spend very little.\n    * *Strategy:* Target with \"High-Yield Investment\" offers or value-based promotions to unlock their potential.\n\n2.  **The Generalists (Average Spend, Average Income):**\n    * *Observation:* The largest group with moderate behavior.\n    * *Strategy:* Retain with standard loyalty programs and periodic sales.\n\n3.  **The Targets / VIPs (High Spend, High Income):**\n    * *Observation:* The most valuable segment.\n    * *Strategy:* Assign dedicated relationship managers, offer exclusive access to new products, and VIP events.\n\n4.  **The Spendthrifts (High Spend, Low Income):**\n    * *Observation:* Young or impulsive buyers who spend beyond their means.\n    * *Strategy:* Recommended budget-friendly \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" options or discount coupons to maintain volume.\n\n5.  **The Conservatives (Low Spend, Low Income):**\n    * *Strategy:* Monitor churn but prioritize marketing spend on higher-yield segments.","metadata":{}}]}
